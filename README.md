## Autostart
Allows you to animate without code. Don't need to use this is if you plan to start the animation in code.

## Autohide
Saves you the hassle of adding a line "layer.alpha = 0" in viewDidLoad().

## Known issue
Animations won't autostart when view is reached via performSegueWithIdentifier.

Animations using IBInspectables are currently not working in iOS 7. iOS 8 is supported. We're looking for a fix. Animations in code works for both iOS 7 and 8.

This project now requires Xcode 6.3 and Swift 1.2. For old version please download [1.0.2](https://github.com/MengTo/Spring/tree/1.0.2)
